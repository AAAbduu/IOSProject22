I have not forgotten those days, my old friend!                                    
Find the kid, come back later and we will have that beer like in those old days.         
By the way, you should look in the park. Now it is closed, you know maintenance stuff.   
We usually find drunk idiots there, the key is on the table, go and have a look.
