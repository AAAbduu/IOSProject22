HOME: 


Home sweet home, or at leastwhat it used to be... Since my wife died, it is not the same anymore.
It feels colder, gloomier and blue. Clearly those shiny days with her in my arms 
is what I miss the most...


MAINSQUARE: 

Scumbag, all I can see, I remember how these "people" used to treat me when I needed 
them the most, even though I have been guarding this ungrateful town for almost
three decades. Raise crows, and they'll gouge out your eyes...

CASTLE: 

I used to work huh! 30 years of serving the king, which I consider my only friend...
alongside all the beers I have daily hehe.

PUB: 

The only place where I find peace, when I get numb, every pain goes away.
I can still handle this life just because I can numb away this sorrow.

FOREST:

It had been a while since I last came here, nobody really goes in there, 
it is just dark and cold, strange beasts walk around. It's becoming more
dangerous...

PORT:

Sometime I like fishing, and here is where obviosuly I come, I know it's boring
but some sense of humanity and compassion invades my body and my soul, hope seems
to appear in the skyline when sun is setting but I am never able to reach any of it...
