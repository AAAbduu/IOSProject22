HOME: 


Home sweet home, or that is what it was, since my wife died, it is not the same.
It feels colder, darker and sad. Clearly those shiny days with her in my arms 
is what i miss the most...


MAINSQUARE: 

Scumbag, all i can see, i remember how this "people" treated me when i needed 
someone the most, even though i have been guarding this ungrateful city for almost
30 years. Raise crows, and they'll gouge out your eyes...

CASTLE: 

Where i worked eh? 30 years serving the same king, which i consider my only friend
alongside all the beers i have daily.

PUB: 

The only place i find some peace, when i get numb, every pain goes away.
I can still handle this life just because i can numb away this sorrow.

FOREST:

It is been a lot since i came last here, nobody really goes in there 
it is dark and cold, strange beasts walk around. It has become more
dangerous...

PORT:

Sometime i like fishing and here is obviosuly where i come, i know it is boring
but some sense of humanity and compassion invades my body and soul, hope seems
to appear in the skyline when sun is setting but i am never able to reach any of it...
