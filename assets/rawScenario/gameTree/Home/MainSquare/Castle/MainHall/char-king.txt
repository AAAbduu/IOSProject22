Ho ho ho... Since when finding something has been a problem for who used to be my personal guard.    
I have not forgotten those days, my old friend!                                    
Find the kid! And come back later my friend! We will have a nice drink like the old days ho ho ho...
By the way, you should look in the park. Now it is closed, you know maintenance stuff.   
We usually find drunk idiots there, the key is on the table, take it!
