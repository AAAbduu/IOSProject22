Are you not looking for my kid? *sobbing* Where are you going? To the pub again? to get drunk?
Don't you have any heart at all? Have you forgotten what happened last month with the prince?
He was kidnapped until the king paid the rescue, God knows what atricities the kid had to go through.
Go find my child! nobody knows the pain a mother feels for her child
